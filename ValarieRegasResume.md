# VALARIE ANN REGAS 

From bar bouncing to office management, from being a full-time caregiver to my tiny humans to DevOps, I've done a lot of fun, demanding, difficult things. But DevOps, and the creation of software, has stolen my heart! I am enthusiastic about making things efficient, and automating tasks brings me joy. 

I envision a perfect world, in which software is so thoroughly planned, developed with passion, tested to the limits, and deployed automatically, that the team's on-call schedule becomes a joke. A world where we can deploy Friday at 4:45PM, and still spend the weekend away from work. Dare to dream, and dream big!
